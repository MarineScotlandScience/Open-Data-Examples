# Open-Data-Examples
Example scripts and methods for working with Marine Scotland Science Open Data.
The examples will mainly focus on retrieving data from the Marine Scotland Open data network.

The network consists of 3 portals:

Marine Scotland Data: https://data.marine.gov.scot

Marine Scotland Information: http://marine.gov.scot

Marine Scotland Maps: http://maps.marine.gov.scot

The individual examples can be found in folders. 
Each example will take you through how to connect and download the data, and typically also some examples of graphing or analysing the data as well.

The example folders are currently:

**Salmon and Sea Trout**

An example of searching the marine scotland data portal, and creating annual summary plots by Scottish Marine Regions

**SCOBS**

Scottish Coastal Observatory data. Environmental and biological data from multiple coastal monitoring sites are being publised. The scripts included here are meant as examples to aid in the retrieval and use of the data.
